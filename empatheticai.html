        <h3>At the mention of artificial intelligence, or AI, most people think of robots like the ones on the assembly line or chatbots like OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. An Empathetic AI is unlike a robot on the assembly line or a chatbot. It is an AI that has the ability to detect a wide variety of human emotions, and has the ability to respond accordingly to these emotions. Empathetic AI has the ability to revolutionize the cyberspace and to allow for civil online interactions, which can benefit the well-being of the future.

            Empathetic AI is a fairly new field of AI. With newly developed training techniques, researchers are able to fine-tune large language models like GPT to be able to identify different emotions at a far greater accuracy than before. With these well-trained AI models, places like social media and other forms of cyberspaces can become more and more civilized. Such examples of an AI “moderator” could be a Emotional Paraphrasing AI model, which can make suggestions to social media users to think about their messages and if they want to have a more civil conversation. Other forms of Empathetic AI can be used in places like healthcare, education, customer service etc.

            An AI that can detect human emotions could make a huge change to the world we know now. With these rapid changes to our society, it is important that students are educated on AI. AI education helps make informed decisions on their use of AI, which helps ensure ethical AI development. In the wake of ChatGPT, many top tech officials debate what the best course of action should be on AI, with some calling for the advancement of AI to be halted. Education also allows for innovation to thrive, in any field. The spark of innovation is what drives the advancement of society and the betterment of people’s lives.
