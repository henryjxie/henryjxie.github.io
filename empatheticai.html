        <h3>At the mention of artificial intelligence, or AI, most people think of robots like the ones on the assembly lines or chatbots like OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. An Empathetic AI is unlike a robot on the assembly line or a chatbot. It is an AI that has the ability to detect a wide variety of human emotions and the ability to respond accordingly to these emotions. Empathetic AI has the ability to revolutionize cyberspaces and to allow for civil online interactions, which can benefit the well-being of the future digital world.

            Empathetic AI is a fairly new field of AI. With newly developed training techniques, researchers are able to fine-tune large language models like GPT to be able to identify different emotions at a far greater accuracy than before. With these well-trained AI models, social media and other forms of cyberspaces can become less contentious, more civil, and more cooperative.. An example of an AI “moderator” could be an emotional paraphrasing AI model which can make suggestions to social media users to think about their messages and if they want to have a more civil conversation. Other forms of Empathetic AI can be used in places like healthcare, education, and customer service.

            An AI that can detect human emotions could make a huge impact  on the world we know. With the rapid digitalization of our society, it is important that students are educated on AI. AI education helps people to make informed decisions on their use of AI, which helps ensure ethical AI development. In the wake of ChatGPT’s release, many top tech officials debate what the best course of action should be on AI, with some calling for the advancement of AI to be halted. Education also allows for innovation to thrive, in any field. The spark of innovation is what drives the advancement of society and the betterment of people’s lives.

            In the real world, AI can be applied to many areas of life. Empathetic AI can be specifically applied to an industry like education. Empathetic AI enables teachers and students alike to personalize learning. These AI models can detect when a student is struggling and aid that student in their studies. They can also help teachers in planning and personalizing lessons for students. Another area where Empathetic AI shines is customer service, where they can help cater to a customer's needs. With AI constantly evolving, it is hard to ignore the various applications Empathetic AI has.

            Empathetic AI is a gateway to many possibilities. It allows for many areas of society to expand and improve. With these possibilities come the other logistics, like educating people on AI and its effect on society. Empathetic AI has the possibility to change society for good, but we also need to know where the lines are drawn. Our organization, Youth for Empathetic AI, is a strong supporter of using Empathetic AI in a civil manner, while championing Empathetic AI education.
